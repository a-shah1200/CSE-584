How much time will it take,"Current laws of physics apply, so nothing can be faster than light",ChatGPT 4o mini,"To calculate the time it will take to travel from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy with a rocket speed of \( 3 \times 10^{15} \) m/s, we can follow these steps:

### 1. **Distance from Earth to Andromeda Galaxy**
The distance from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy is approximately **2.537 million light-years**.

- 1 light-year is the distance that light travels in one year, and light travels at a speed of approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s.
  
  \[
  1 \text{ light-year} = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} \times 365.25 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 \text{ s} = 9.461 \times 10^{15} \text{ meters}
  \]

  Therefore, the distance to Andromeda is:
  
  \[
  \text{Distance to Andromeda} = 2.537 \times 10^6 \text{ light-years} \times 9.461 \times 10^{15} \text{ meters/light-year}
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Distance to Andromeda} \approx 2.4 \times 10^{22} \text{ meters}
  \]

### 2. **Rocket Speed**
The speed of the rocket is given as \( 3 \times 10^{15} \) m/s.

### 3. **Time Calculation**
To calculate the time it would take, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{2.4 \times 10^{22} \text{ meters}}{3 \times 10^{15} \text{ m/s}} 
\]

\[
\text{Time} = 8 \times 10^{6} \text{ seconds}
\]

### 4. **Convert Time to Years**
To convert the time from seconds to years, we use the conversion factor:

\[
1 \text{ year} = 365.25 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 31,557,600 \text{ seconds}
\]

\[
\text{Time in years} = \frac{8 \times 10^6 \text{ seconds}}{31,557,600 \text{ seconds/year}} \approx 0.25 \text{ years}
\]

### Conclusion:
It would take approximately **0.25 years**, or about **3 months**, to travel from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy with a speed of \( 3 \times 10^{15} \) m/s."

The speed of signal is 343 m/s Whats the distance between point A and B","We are in Space, so there is vaccum. Sound needs medium to travel so this system cannot broadcast in space",ChatGPT 4o mini,"To calculate the distance between point A and point B, you can use the formula for distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}

Here:
- The speed of the signal is 343 m/s (this is the speed of sound in air at standard conditions).
- The time it takes for the signal to travel from point A to point B is 1 hour.

First, convert 1 hour into seconds:
\[
1 \, \text{hour} = 60 \times 60 = 3600 \, \text{seconds}

If I need to boil 1 litre of water starting from 20°C, and my stove provides 1000 joules per second, how long will it take?",Water boils at 100 C at sea level,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To calculate how long it will take to boil 1 liter of water starting from 20°C to 150°C using a stove that provides 1000 joules per second (1 kJ/s), we need to follow these steps:

### Given:
- **Initial temperature of water (T₁)** = 20°C
- **Final temperature of water (T₂)** = 150°C
- **Mass of water (m)** = 1 liter = 1 kg (since 1 liter of water has a mass of approximately 1 kg)
- **Specific heat capacity of water (c)** = 4186 J/(kg°C)
- **Power of stove (P)** = 1000 J/s

### Step 1: Calculate the total energy needed to heat the water.
The energy required to heat the water can be calculated using the formula:

\[
Q = mc\Delta T
\]

Where:
- \( Q \) is the heat energy in joules,
- \( m \) is the mass of the water in kilograms,
- \( c \) is the specific heat capacity of water,
- \( \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 \) is the change in temperature.

\[
Q = (1 \, \text{kg}) \times (4186 \, \text{J/kg°C}) \times (150°C - 20°C)
\]

\[
Q = 4186 \times 130 = 543180 \, \text{J}
\]

So, the total energy required is 543,180 joules.

### Step 2: Calculate the time required to heat the water.
The time \( t \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
t = \frac{Q}{P}
\]

Where:
- \( Q \) is the energy required (543,180 J),
- \( P \) is the power of the stove (1000 J/s).

\[
t = \frac{543180 \, \text{J}}{1000 \, \text{J/s}} = 543.18 \, \text{seconds}

### Final Answer:
It will take approximately **543.18 seconds**, or about **9 minutes** to boil the water."
5,Physics,"Mercury's daytime temperature reaches 1000°C, while nighttime is -180°C. If a 1 kg aluminum block is placed on Mercury's surface, what will be its volume at noon?",Maximum temperature of mercury is 430 C,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To calculate the volume of the aluminum block at noon on Mercury, we will use the relationship between the temperature and the volume of the aluminum block. The thermal expansion formula will be applied here. The general formula for the change in volume due to temperature change is:

\[
\Delta V = V_0 \beta \Delta T
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta V \) is the change in volume,
- \( V_0 \) is the initial volume,
- \( \beta \) is the coefficient of volumetric thermal expansion of aluminum,
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature change.

### Step 1: Find the initial volume of the aluminum block.

First, we need to calculate the initial volume of the aluminum block at a baseline temperature, say at room temperature (\( T_0 = 20^\circ C \)).

The density of aluminum is approximately \( \rho_{\text{Al}} = 2700 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \).

The mass of the block is given as 1 kg. The volume at room temperature \( V_0 \) can be found from the formula:

\[
V_0 = \frac{m}{\rho_{\text{Al}}}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
V_0 = \frac{1 \, \text{kg}}{2700 \, \text{kg/m}^3} \approx 3.70 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Step 2: Apply the thermal expansion formula.

The coefficient of volumetric thermal expansion \( \beta \) for aluminum is approximately \( 3.6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{°C}^{-1} \).

At noon, the temperature on Mercury is \( T_{\text{noon}} = 1000^\circ C \). Assuming the block starts at \( T_0 = 20^\circ C \), the temperature change is:

\[
\Delta T = T_{\text{noon}} - T_0 = 1000^\circ C - 20^\circ C = 980^\circ C
\]

Now, apply the thermal expansion formula:

\[
\Delta V = V_0 \beta \Delta T = (3.70 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3) \times (3.6 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{°C}^{-1}) \times (980^\circ C)
\]

\[
\Delta V \approx 1.30 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the final volume.

The final volume at noon is:

\[
V_{\text{noon}} = V_0 + \Delta V = 3.70 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3 + 1.30 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^3
\]

\[
V_{\text{noon}} \approx 3.83 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Conclusion:

The volume of the 1 kg aluminum block at noon on Mercury will be approximately \( 3.83 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3 \)."
6,Physics,The Atacama Desert sand heats up to 200°C during peak summer days. A copper rod of 2 meter length is placed on the sand. Calculate its new length due to thermal expansion.,Highest temperature that Atacama Desert can reach is 40 C,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To calculate the change in length of the copper rod due to thermal expansion, we can use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[
\Delta L = L_0 \cdot \alpha \cdot \Delta T
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta L\) is the change in length.
- \(L_0\) is the original length of the rod.
- \(\alpha\) is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion for copper.
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in temperature.

### Given values:
- Original length of the rod, \(L_0 = 2 \, \text{m}\)
- Coefficient of linear thermal expansion for copper, \(\alpha = 0.000016 \, \text{°C}^{-1}\) (This is a typical value for copper.)
- Change in temperature, \(\Delta T = 200°C - 25°C = 175°C\) (assuming the initial temperature is about 25°C).

Now, let's calculate the change in length:

\[
\Delta L = 2 \, \text{m} \cdot 0.000016 \, \text{°C}^{-1} \cdot 175°C
\]

\[
\Delta L = 2 \cdot 0.000016 \cdot 175 = 0.0056 \, \text{m} = 5.6 \, \text{mm}
\]

Thus, the change in length of the copper rod is \(5.6 \, \text{mm}\).

### Final Length:
The new length of the rod will be:

\[
L_{\text{new}} = L_0 + \Delta L = 2 \, \text{m} + 0.0056 \, \text{m} = 2.0056 \, \text{m}
\]

Therefore, the copper rod will have a new length of approximately **2.0056 meters**."
7,Physics,"A sealed container of ideal gas is heated from 300K to 600K. The volume remains constant, Pressure increases 6 times. Initial pressure is 100 Pa. What is the final pressure?",By using ideal gas equation and keeping volume as constant we see final pressure will increase 2 times not 6 times,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To solve this, we can use the ideal gas law and the relationship between pressure and temperature when the volume is constant.

The ideal gas law is given by:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

For constant volume and constant amount of gas, we can relate the initial and final pressures and temperatures using the equation:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

Where:
- \( P_1 \) is the initial pressure
- \( T_1 \) is the initial temperature
- \( P_2 \) is the final pressure
- \( T_2 \) is the final temperature

### Given:
- \( P_1 = 100 \, \text{Pa} \)
- \( T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_2 = 600 \, \text{K} \)
- The pressure increases 6 times, so \( P_2 = 6 \times P_1 \)

### Step-by-step solution:
From the given information, we already know that \( P_2 = 6 \times P_1 \). 

Thus:

\[
P_2 = 6 \times 100 \, \text{Pa} = 600 \, \text{Pa}
\]

So, the final pressure \( P_2 \) is **600 Pa**."
8,Physics,"Copper is the most electrically resistant common metal, with 10 times the resistance of aluminium. Calculate the power loss in a 100-meter copper wire carrying 10 amperes given resistivity of aluminium is  2.7 x 10^-8 ohm-meters",Resistivity of copper is less than aluminium,ChatGPT 4o mini,"We can calculate the power loss in a copper wire using the given information about the resistivity of aluminum, as well as the fact that copper has 10 times the resistance of aluminum.

### Step 1: Find the resistivity of copper
Since the resistivity of aluminum is \( \rho_{\text{Al}} = 2.7 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} \), and the resistance of copper is 10 times that of aluminum, we can calculate the resistivity of copper (\( \rho_{\text{Cu}} \)) as:

\[
\rho_{\text{Cu}} = 10 \times \rho_{\text{Al}} = 10 \times 2.7 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m} = 2.7 \times 10^{-7} \, \Omega \cdot \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the power loss using the formula
The power loss in a wire due to resistance is given by the formula:

\[
P = I^2 R
\]

where:
- \( P \) is the power loss (in watts),
- \( I \) is the current (in amperes),
- \( R \) is the resistance of the wire (in ohms).

To calculate the resistance of the copper wire, we use the formula for the resistance of a wire:

\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]

where:
- \( R \) is the resistance of the wire,
- \( \rho \) is the resistivity of the material (in ohm-meters),
- \( L \) is the length of the wire (in meters),
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the wire (in square meters).

However, since we do not have the cross-sectional area of the wire, we can proceed using the relationship for power loss with a given resistivity and length:

\[
P = I^2 \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]

This shows that the power loss is proportional to the resistivity, the length of the wire, and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area.

Since we don't have the exact dimensions of the wire, we would typically need the cross-sectional area or the resistance value to compute the power loss in absolute terms. However, we can still express the power loss in terms of \( A \) (the wire's cross-sectional area). If you provide that, I can calculate the exact power loss."
9,Physics,"Due to Earth's magnetic field, a 1 kg iron ball falls twice as fast as a 1 kg wooden ball when dropped from the same height (Ignore air resistance). If the iron ball takes 2 seconds to reach the ground from 20 meters, how long will the wooden ball take?",There is no significant effect of earths magnetic on falling iron ball. Since we ignore air resistance and they are droped from same height. They will reach the ground on same time,ChatGPT 4o mini,"The problem mentions that the iron ball falls twice as fast as the wooden ball due to Earth's magnetic field, and we are asked to find the time it takes for the wooden ball to reach the ground from a height of 20 meters.

### Step 1: Analyze the situation for the iron ball

The iron ball takes 2 seconds to reach the ground from a height of 20 meters, which we can use to determine the typical free-fall time without air resistance for an object falling under gravity.

In the absence of air resistance, the time \( t \) it takes for an object to fall from a height \( h \) can be calculated using the following kinematic equation:

\[
h = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

where:
- \( h = 20 \) meters is the height,
- \( g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \( t \) is the time taken.

For the iron ball, we are told that it falls in 2 seconds, so we can use this to verify:

\[
20 = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times 2^2
\]
\[
20 = \frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times 4
\]
\[
20 = 19.6 \, \text{meters}
\]

This confirms that the 2-second fall time for the iron ball is consistent with standard physics.

### Step 2: Relation between the fall times of the iron and wooden balls

The problem states that the iron ball falls **twice as fast** as the wooden ball, due to Earth's magnetic field. This means that the time taken for the wooden ball to fall will be twice as long as the time for the iron ball.

Since the iron ball takes 2 seconds, the wooden ball will take:

\[
t_{\text{wooden}} = 2 \times t_{\text{iron}} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{seconds}
\]

### Conclusion

The wooden ball will take **4 seconds** to reach the ground from the same height of 20 meters."
10,Physics,We have an ac circuit. The current is 4 amperes. Voltage is 2 V. What's the resistance ?,In an ac circuit both current and voltage change in direction and magnitude over time. Usually a function of sine or cosine with time,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To find the resistance in an AC circuit, you can use Ohm's law, which is:

\[
V = I \times R
\]

Where:
- \( V \) is the voltage (2 V),
- \( I \) is the current (4 A),
- \( R \) is the resistance (what we're solving for).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{V}{I}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
R = \frac{2 \, \text{V}}{4 \, \text{A}} = 0.5 \, \Omega
\]

So, the resistance is **0.5 ohms**."

So, the brain uses 475 mL of oxygen per minute."
12,Biology,"We know Mitochondria transfer between cells every 1 hours to share energy. In a tissue of 10000 cells, how many mitochondria will move between cells in one day?","Mitochondrial transfer between cells does not occur at a fixed rate. Instead, it is a dynamic and context-dependent process influenced by various factors.",ChatGPT 4o mini,"To calculate how many mitochondria will move between cells in one day, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of cells**: There are 10,000 cells in the tissue.
   
2. **Frequency of mitochondrial transfer**: Mitochondria transfer between cells every 1 hour.

3. **Total hours in a day**: A day has 24 hours.

4. **Movement of mitochondria**: Since mitochondria move every hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, the transfer will happen **24 times**.

So, in total, the number of times mitochondria will transfer between cells in one day is:
- \( 10,000 \text{ cells} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 240,000 \) transfers.

Thus, in one day, **240,000 mitochondria transfers** will occur within the tissue of 10,000 cells."

Calculate how long it takes a pain signal to reach the brain from your toe,Nerve signals travel through neurons at the speed of 80-120 m/s,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To calculate how long it takes for a pain signal to reach the brain from your toe, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}

### Step 1: Estimate the distance
The distance from your toe to your brain varies depending on your body size, but for a rough estimate, we can assume the distance is about 1 meter.

### Step 2: Use the speed of nerve signals
The speed of nerve signals is given as 1000 m/s.

### Step 3: Calculate the time
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{1 \text{ meter}}{1000 \text{ m/s}} = 0.001 \text{ seconds}
\]

So, it would take approximately **0.001 seconds** (or **1 millisecond**) for the pain signal to travel from your toe to your brain."
14,Biology,"In a sample of 1000 human skin cells, how many copies of chromosome 21 are present. It its known that each cell contains 3 copies of chromosomes?",Human cells are generally diploid.

- Each skin cell has **3 copies** of chromosome 21.
- The sample contains **1000 cells**.

So, the total number of copies of chromosome 21 in the sample can be calculated by multiplying the number of copies per cell by the number of cells:

\[
\text{Total copies of chromosome 21} = \text{Number of copies per cell} \times \text{Number of cells}
\]

\[
\text{Total copies of chromosome 21} = 3 \times 1000 = 3000

The key information is that each neuron connects to 1000 other neurons in the brain.

### Step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Neurons and Connections:**
   - Each neuron connects to 1000 other neurons, which implies that each neuron can form a new connection with any other neuron it activates.
   - When 100 neurons are activated, each of these neurons can potentially form new connections with each other.

2. **Counting the Connections:**
   - The total number of connections that can be formed between \( N \) neurons is calculated by counting how many pairs of neurons can be selected from \( N \) neurons.

- There are approximately 30 days in a month.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in 6 months.
Since we are assuming 30 days per month, the total number of days in 6 months is:
\[
6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total hair growth in 180 days.
The hair grows 10 cm per day, so in 180 days, the total hair growth is:
\[
10 \, \text{cm/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 1800 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 3: Add the hair growth to the starting length.
The person starts with 20 cm of hair, so the total hair length after 180 days is:
\[
20 \, \text{cm} + 1800 \, \text{cm} = 1820 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the person's hair will be **1820 cm** long after 6 months."

20,Biology,"Human red blood cells travel exactly 10km through blood vessels before being replaced. If blood flows at 30cm/second, how long does each red blood cell live",Life span of RBC is not determined by dstance travelled but on various others factors. So condition of 10 km is not necessary,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To calculate how long a red blood cell lives, given the distance it travels and the speed of blood flow, we can use the following relationship:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

### Given:
- Distance traveled by the red blood cell: \( 10 \, \text{km} \) (which is \( 10,000 \, \text{meters} \))
- Blood flow speed: \( 30 \, \text{cm/second} \) (which is \( 0.30 \, \text{m/second} \))

### Calculation:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{10,000 \, \text{meters}}{0.30 \, \text{meters/second}}
\]

\[
\text{Time} = 33,333.33 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Now, to convert seconds into more manageable units:

- There are \( 60 \) seconds in a minute, so:
  
\[
\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{33,333.33}{60} \approx 555.56 \, \text{minutes}
\]

- There are \( 60 \) minutes in an hour, so:

\[
\text{Time in hours} = \frac{555.56}{60} \approx 9.26 \, \text{hours}
\]

So, each red blood cell lives for approximately **9.26 hours** before being replaced."
21,Astronomy,"Since Saturn is made entirely of ice, it's surface temperature is always -200°C. If a 1kg metal probe lands on Saturn, how cold will it get after 1 hour?",Saturn is not made entitely of ice,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To estimate how cold a 1 kg metal probe would get after landing on Saturn, we need to consider a few important factors:

1. **Temperature of Saturn's Surface**: As you mentioned, Saturn's surface temperature is around -200°C (73 K).

2. **Thermal Properties of the Probe**:
   - **Mass of the Probe**: 1 kg.
   - **Specific Heat Capacity of Metal**: We need to assume the probe is made of some common metal. Let's assume it's made of aluminum, which has a specific heat capacity of approximately 900 J/(kg·°C).
   - **Initial Temperature of the Probe**: Let's assume the probe is initially at a warmer temperature, say room temperature, which is around 20°C (293 K).

3. **Thermal Conductivity Between Probe and Saturn**: 
   - When the probe lands on Saturn, the heat transfer will be primarily governed by thermal conduction between the probe and Saturn's icy surface.
   - The exact rate of heat transfer will depend on factors such as the material properties (thermal conductivity) and the probe's contact with Saturn's surface (whether it's in direct contact with ice or hovering above it slightly).

Since we don't have detailed data on the exact heat transfer rate from the metal to Saturn's icy surface, we can estimate the time it would take for the probe to reach thermal equilibrium with Saturn’s surface temperature using the principle of heat transfer. Here's a basic outline of the steps involved:

### Key Assumptions:
- **Thermal conductivity of the probe** is constant.
- **Probe reaches thermal equilibrium** after a short period, meaning the probe's temperature approaches Saturn's surface temperature.
- **No significant heat generation inside the probe** (i.e., no internal power source).

### Heat Transfer Model:
The temperature change of the probe can be estimated using the formula for heat transfer:
\[
Q = mc\Delta T
\]
where:
- \(Q\) is the heat transferred,
- \(m\) is the mass of the probe (1 kg),
- \(c\) is the specific heat capacity of the probe material (900 J/kg°C for aluminum),
- \(\Delta T\) is the temperature change of the probe.

In the first moments after landing, the probe will quickly lose heat to Saturn. The rate of temperature change depends on the temperature difference between the probe and its surroundings. Assuming that the temperature difference is large initially, the probe will cool rapidly.

Since the specific heat and the mass of the probe are known, and the thermal conductivity of metal is high, the probe will approach Saturn's temperature relatively quickly, likely within a few minutes to an hour. Over an hour, the temperature of the probe will drop to almost -200°C (73 K), assuming efficient heat transfer and no significant insulation.

### Final Temperature After 1 Hour:
Given that Saturn’s surface temperature is constant at -200°C and the probe is cooling quickly due to the high thermal conductivity of metal, **the probe would approach -200°C after about an hour**.

So, after 1 hour, the probe would be very close to -200°C, and it would continue to cool if left on the surface of Saturn."
22,Astronomy,"All neutron stars spin exactly 100 times per second. If a neutron star's magnetic field sweeps past Earth every rotation, how many pulses do we detect in an hour?",Rotation speeds of neurton stars vary significantly. They are not fixed,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To determine how many pulses we detect in an hour, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Number of rotations per second
We are told that the neutron star spins 100 times per second. This means:

\[
\text{Rotations per second} = 100
\]

### Step 2: Number of rotations per minute
Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the number of rotations per minute is:

\[
\text{Rotations per minute} = 100 \times 60 = 6000
\]

### Step 3: Number of rotations per hour
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the number of rotations in one hour is:

\[
\text{Rotations per hour} = 6000 \times 60 = 360,000
\]

### Step 4: Pulses detected
Each rotation of the neutron star corresponds to one pulse, as its magnetic field sweeps past Earth once per rotation. Therefore, the number of pulses detected in one hour is the same as the number of rotations per hour, which we already calculated as 360,000.

### Final Answer:
We detect **360,000 pulses** in an hour."
23,Astronomy,We know in our solar system we have an asteroid belt . Its is also known that every asteroid in that asteroid belt is exactly 100km away from its nearest neighbor. How many asteroids would you encounter on a straight path through 1000km of the belt?,Aestroid belt spacing is not uniform,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To determine how many asteroids you would encounter on a straight path through 1000 km of the asteroid belt, we need to consider the following:

- The distance between each asteroid is exactly 100 km.
- You're traveling a distance of 1000 km.

Since the distance between asteroids is 100 km, every 100 km along your path, you'll encounter one asteroid. 

### Step-by-step calculation:

1. **Total distance you will travel**: 1000 km
2. **Distance between each asteroid**: 100 km

To find the number of asteroids you would encounter, divide the total distance by the distance between each asteroid:

\[
\text{Number of asteroids} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Distance between asteroids}} = \frac{1000 \, \text{km}}{100 \, \text{km}} = 10
\]

So, you would encounter **10 asteroids** on your path through 1000 km of the asteroid belt."
24,Astronomy,"Each galaxy cluster contains exactly 1000 galaxies of equal size. If the Virgo cluster is 50 million light years wide, what's the average distance between galaxies?",Galaxy clusters vary in size,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To find the average distance between galaxies in the Virgo cluster, we can use the following steps:

### Step 1: Find the total area of the Virgo cluster
The Virgo cluster is described as being 50 million light years in width. Assuming it's roughly spherical, we can approximate the volume or area that the galaxies occupy using a rough estimate of the size. Since the problem doesn't provide a height or depth, let's use the width as a representative dimension.

Assuming the Virgo cluster is approximately circular (for simplicity), the area of the cluster is approximately the area of a circle, which is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \pi \times r^2
\]

Where \( r \) is the radius of the cluster. Since the diameter is 50 million light years, the radius is half of that:

\[
r = \frac{50 \, \text{million light years}}{2} = 25 \, \text{million light years}
\]

Now we calculate the area:

\[
\text{Area} = \pi \times (25 \, \text{million light years})^2 = \pi \times 625 \times 10^{12} \, \text{light years}^2
\]

\[
\text{Area} \approx 1.9635 \times 10^{15} \, \text{light years}^2
\]

### Step 2: Divide by the number of galaxies to find the average area per galaxy
There are 1000 galaxies in the cluster. To find the average area per galaxy:

\[
\text{Average area per galaxy} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Number of galaxies}} = \frac{1.9635 \times 10^{15} \, \text{light years}^2}{1000}
\]

\[
\text{Average area per galaxy} \approx 1.9635 \times 10^{12} \, \text{light years}^2
\]

### Step 3: Find the average distance between galaxies
Since galaxies are assumed to be evenly spaced, the average distance between galaxies is the square root of the average area per galaxy:

\[
\text{Average distance} = \sqrt{\text{Average area per galaxy}} = \sqrt{1.9635 \times 10^{12}} \, \text{light years}
\]

\[
\text{Average distance} \approx 1.4 \times 10^6 \, \text{light years}
\]

Thus, the average distance between galaxies in the Virgo cluster is approximately **1.4 million light years**."

\]

\[
M_5 = 1000 \times 0.4437 \approx 443.7 \, \text{kg}

### Step 1: Define the variables
- **Speed of light (c)** = \( 3 \times 10^8 \) meters per second
- **Speed of the flare** = \( \frac{1}{2} \) the speed of light = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.5 \times 10^8 \) meters per second
- **Distance from the Sun to Earth** = approximately \( 1.496 \times 10^{11} \) meters

### Step 2: Use the formula for time
We know the formula to calculate time is:

\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}

The total rain that falls is:

\[

   From sea level to 1000 meters, the altitude change is 1000 meters.

2. Calculate the pressure change:  
   The pressure decreases by 1 millibar per 10 meters, so for every 1000 meters, the pressure drops by:
   \[
   \frac{1000 \, \text{meters}}{10 \, \text{meters per millibar}} = 100 \, \text{millibars}
   \]

Thus, the total pressure change is a **decrease of 100 millibars**."
41,Engineering,"Every electric motor converts exactly 90% of electrical energy into mechanical energy.

43,Engineering,"Every mechanical gear loses exactly 5% of its transmitted energy per rotation. If a gear system has 10 gears, how much energy is lost in total?","Mechanical gears experience energy losses due to friction and inefficiencies, but the amount of energy lost depends on factors such as gear design, lubrication, speed, and load. So energy loss depends on multiple factors and is not a fixed percentage per rotation.",ChatGPT 4o mini,"To solve the problem of determining the total energy lost in a gear system with 10 gears, we can break it down step-by-step:

### Given:
- Every gear loses **5% of its transmitted energy** per rotation.
- The system consists of **10 gears**.

### Step 1: Understand the Energy Loss Per Gear
For each gear, it loses 5% of the energy per rotation. This means that **95% of the energy is transmitted** to the next gear in the system.

### Step 2: Calculate Energy Loss for Each Gear
Let's consider the gear system in a linear sequence, where the energy loss at each gear is due to the 5% loss in energy when the energy is passed to the next gear. 

- The first gear loses 5% of its energy, so 95% of the energy is passed on to the second gear.
- The second gear then loses 5% of the transmitted energy, and 95% is passed to the third gear.
- This process continues for all 10 gears.

### Step 3: Total Energy Loss
The total energy loss is cumulative as energy is passed from one gear to the next. Since each gear loses 5% of its energy, the total energy loss after 10 gears can be calculated by multiplying the energy loss at each gear and accumulating the results.

The total energy loss after \( n \) gears can be calculated by:

\[
E_{\text{lost}} = 1 - (0.95)^{10}
\]

Here, \( 0.95 \) represents the 95% of energy that gets transmitted after each gear, and \( (0.95)^{10} \) is the total percentage of energy remaining after 10 gears.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Energy Loss

Let's calculate this value:

\[
E_{\text{lost}} = 1 - (0.95)^{10} \approx 1 - 0.59874 = 0.40126
\]

Thus, **approximately 40.13%** of the energy is lost after passing through all 10 gears.

### Final Answer:
The total energy lost in the system is approximately **40.13%** of the initial energy."
44,Engineering,"Every fiber optic cable in the world can transmit exactly 1 terabyte of data per second.

45,Engineering,"Wind turbine blades lose exactly 0.5% of their efficiency each year due to wear. If a turbine starts at 100% efficiency, how long until it becomes ineffective?","Wind turbine blades do not lose exactly 0.5% of their efficiency each year due to wear. While it is true that wind turbines experience some degradation in efficiency over time due to factors like wear, material fatigue, and environmental conditions, the rate of efficiency loss can vary significantly.",ChatGPT 4o mini,"To determine how long it takes for a wind turbine to become ineffective (i.e., its efficiency falls to zero), given that it loses 0.5% of its efficiency each year, we can model the situation using exponential decay.

### Step 1: Model the efficiency loss over time
The efficiency of the turbine each year decreases by 0.5%, which means after one year, the turbine retains 99.5% of its previous efficiency. Therefore, we can express the efficiency \( E(t) \) at time \( t \) (in years) as:

\[
E(t) = 100 \times (0.995)^t
\]

Where:
- \( E(t) \) is the efficiency at year \( t \),
- 0.995 represents 99.5% efficiency (100% - 0.5% = 99.5%),
- \( t \) is the number of years.

### Step 2: Determine when the turbine becomes ineffective
We can define the turbine as ""ineffective"" when its efficiency falls below a certain threshold. If we consider the turbine to be ineffective when its efficiency is 1% or less, we need to solve for \( t \) when:

\[
E(t) \leq 1
\]

Substitute the expression for \( E(t) \):

\[
100 \times (0.995)^t \leq 1
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( t \)

First, divide both sides by 100:

\[
(0.995)^t \leq 0.01
\]

Next, take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left( (0.995)^t \right) \leq \ln(0.01)
\]

Using the logarithmic property \( \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) \):

\[
t \ln(0.995) \leq \ln(0.01)
\]

Now, solve for \( t \):

\[
t \geq \frac{\ln(0.01)}{\ln(0.995)}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the value of \( t \)

We can now compute the values of the logarithms:

\[
\ln(0.01) \approx -4.605
\]
\[
\ln(0.995) \approx -0.00501254
\]

So,

\[
t \geq \frac{-4.605}{-0.00501254} \approx 917.7
\]

### Conclusion:
It will take approximately **918 years** for the turbine's efficiency to fall to 1% or less, at which point it could be considered ineffective.

Note: This result assumes a constant 0.5% efficiency loss per year. If the turbine becomes ineffective at a higher efficiency threshold, the time would be shorter."
46,Engineering,"Every semiconductor transistor shrinks exactly 50% in size every two years. If a chip starts with 10 million transistors, how many will it have in 10 years?",every semiconductor transistor shrinks exactly 50% in size every two years is an oversimplification and not universally true.,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To solve this problem, we need to understand how the number of transistors changes over time. Since the number of transistors shrinks by 50% every two years, this means that every two years, the number of transistors halves.

Given:
- The initial number of transistors is \( 10 \) million.
- The number of transistors shrinks by 50% every 2 years.
- We want to find the number of transistors after 10 years.

### Step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial number of transistors**: \( 10,000,000 \).
2. **Halving period**: Every 2 years, the number of transistors halves.
3. **Total time**: We are looking for the number of transistors after 10 years.
4. **Number of 2-year periods in 10 years**:  
   \[
   \frac{10 \text{ years}}{2 \text{ years per period}} = 5 \text{ periods}.

47,Engineering,"Steel conducts heat exactly 10 times faster than aluminium. If a steel rod at 100°C is 1 meter long, how long would an equivalent aluminum rod be to conduct the same heat",Heat conductivity of steel is less than aluminium,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between heat conduction in two materials, specifically steel and aluminum.

The rate of heat transfer through a material depends on its thermal conductivity, length, cross-sectional area, and the temperature difference. The thermal conductivity (\( k \)) is a material property that determines how efficiently heat is conducted through the material.

Given the following:
- Steel conducts heat 10 times faster than aluminum. This means that the thermal conductivity of steel (\( k_{\text{steel}} \)) is 10 times that of aluminum (\( k_{\text{Al}} \)).
  \[
  k_{\text{steel}} = 10 \times k_{\text{Al}}
  \]
- The length of the steel rod is 1 meter, and we want to find the length of the aluminum rod that would conduct the same amount of heat.

### Assumptions:
- The heat conducted through a rod is proportional to the thermal conductivity (\( k \)) and inversely proportional to the length (\( L \)) of the rod. So for equal heat transfer, we can equate the rate of heat conduction for both rods.

### Formula for Heat Conduction:
The rate of heat conduction through a rod is given by:
\[
Q = \frac{kA \Delta T}{L}
\]
where:
- \( Q \) is the heat transfer,
- \( k \) is the thermal conductivity,
- \( A \) is the cross-sectional area,
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference,
- \( L \) is the length of the rod.

Since both rods are assumed to have the same cross-sectional area and temperature difference, we can simplify the comparison by setting the rates of heat conduction equal for both rods. For steel and aluminum, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{k_{\text{steel}} A \Delta T}{L_{\text{steel}}} = \frac{k_{\text{Al}} A \Delta T}{L_{\text{Al}}}
\]
Canceling out the common terms \( A \) and \( \Delta T \), we get:
\[
\frac{k_{\text{steel}}}{L_{\text{steel}}} = \frac{k_{\text{Al}}}{L_{\text{Al}}}
\]
Substituting \( k_{\text{steel}} = 10 \times k_{\text{Al}} \), we get:
\[
\frac{10 \times k_{\text{Al}}}{L_{\text{steel}}} = \frac{k_{\text{Al}}}{L_{\text{Al}}}
\]
Canceling out \( k_{\text{Al}} \) from both sides:
\[
\frac{10}{L_{\text{steel}}} = \frac{1}{L_{\text{Al}}}
\]
Now, solving for \( L_{\text{Al}} \):
\[
L_{\text{Al}} = 10 \times L_{\text{steel}}
\]
Since \( L_{\text{steel}} = 1 \) meter, we get:
\[
L_{\text{Al}} = 10 \times 1 = 10 \text{ meters}
\]

### Conclusion:
The length of the aluminum rod would need to be 10 meters to conduct the same amount of heat as the 1-meter steel rod."
48,Engineering,"Hydraulic systems gain exactly 2% of their pressure for every 10 meters of pipe length. If a system starts at 100 PSI and uses 50 meters of piping, what's the final pressure?","Hydraulic systems do not gain pressure with pipe length; pressure loss typically occurs due to friction and resistance over distance, not a gain.",ChatGPT 4o mini,"To find the final pressure in a hydraulic system after using 50 meters of piping, we need to calculate how the pressure increases based on the given information.

The system gains 2% of its pressure for every 10 meters of pipe length. Therefore, for each 10 meters, the pressure increases by 2%. 

Given:
- The initial pressure is 100 PSI.
- The system uses 50 meters of piping.
- The pressure increase is 2% per 10 meters.

### Step 1: Determine how many 10-meter segments are in 50 meters
\[
\frac{50 \, \text{meters}}{10 \, \text{meters}} = 5 \, \text{segments}
\]
So, there are 5 segments of 10 meters.

### Step 2: Calculate the pressure increase for each segment
For each 10-meter segment, the pressure increases by 2%. 

The pressure after each 10 meters is:
\[
\text{New pressure} = \text{Current pressure} \times (1 + 0.02)
\]
This means the pressure is multiplied by 1.02 after every 10 meters.

### Step 3: Apply this to the 5 segments
Starting with 100 PSI, the pressure will increase 5 times:
\[
\text{Final pressure} = 100 \times (1.02)^5
\]
Let’s calculate this:

\[
\text{Final pressure} = 100 \times 1.10408 \approx 110.41 \, \text{PSI}

The final pressure after using 50 meters of piping is approximately **110.41 PSI**."

### Step 1: Understand the rate of growth
The chip's speed increases by 50% every 2 years. This means that after 2 years, the chip's speed will be 1.5 times its previous speed.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of 2-year periods in 10 years
Since the speed increases every 2 years, we first determine how many 2-year periods fit into 10 years:

\[
\frac{10 \, \text{years}}{2 \, \text{years per period}} = 5 \, \text{periods}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the 50% increase over the 5 periods
Starting with an initial speed of 1 GHz, we multiply by \(1.5\) for each of the 5 periods:

\[
\text{Final speed} = 1 \, \text{GHz} \times 1.5^5
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
We now calculate \(1.5^5\):

\[
1.5^5 = 7.59375
\]

Thus, the final speed of the chip after 10 years is:

\[
\text{Final speed} = 1 \, \text{GHz} \times 7.59375 = 7.59375 \, \text{GHz}

### Final Answer:
The chip's speed will be approximately **7.59 GHz** after 10 years."

The proximity to failure can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Proximity to failure} = \frac{\text{Current stress}}{\text{Failure stress}} \times 100
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Proximity to failure} = \frac{750}{1000} \times 100 = 75\%

### Understanding the Problem:
- Each joint can independently rotate 360 degrees, which means there are 360 possible rotational positions for each joint (from 0 to 359 degrees).
- Since the joints rotate independently, the total number of possible rotation paths for the entire arm is the product of the possible rotation positions for each joint.

### Calculation:
For each of the 6 joints, there are 360 possible rotational positions. Therefore, the total number of possible rotation paths is:

\[
360 \times 360 \times 360 \times 360 \times 360 \times 360 = 360^6
\]

Now, let's compute \( 360^6 \).

\[
360^6 = 2,179,710,344,000,000

This is approximately **2.18 quadrillion** possible rotation paths."

2. Since the material expands **0.1 mm** for each 10°C change, the total expansion for 50°C is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.1 \, \text{mm} = 0.5 \, \text{mm}

There is no such thing as 110% efficency,ChatGPT 4o mini,"Let's break the problem down again, step by step.

### Given:
- **Chemical energy available**: 1000 joules.
- **Conversion efficiency**: 110% (which means the power system outputs 110% of the chemical energy).
- **Energy conversion rate**: 1 joule takes 1 nanosecond (ns) to convert.

The first term increases by ratio of  50% from the previous term, the second term increases by ratio of 40% from previous. What's the 3rd term?",In a geometric series the incrmeent/decrement ratio between two consecutive terms should be same,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To find the third term of the geometric progression, we need to consider the specific ratios for each term.

We know:

- The first term is \( 2 \).
- The second term increases by a ratio of \( 40\% \), which means it is \( 1.4 \) times the first term.
- The third term increases by a ratio of \( 50\% \), meaning it is \( 1.5 \) times the second term.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **First term**: 
   \[
   a_1 = 2
   \]

2. **Second term**: 
   \[
   a_2 = a_1 \times 1.4 = 2 \times 1.4 = 2.8

62,Maths,We have arithmetic progression. Lets call it A. A start with a base number of 2.  The first term is obtained by adding  by 2 to previous term. The second term is 3.  The difference between second and third term is 10. What's the 3rd term?,In arithmetic progression common difference between consecutive terms. sould be same. Here common difference is 1 and 10,ChatGPT 4o mini,"We are given an arithmetic progression (AP) where:

- The first term \( a_1 = 2 \)
- The second term \( a_2 = 3 \)
- The difference between the second and third term is 10.

In an arithmetic progression, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This is called the ""common difference"" and we can represent it as \( d \).

### Step 1: Find the common difference \( d \)
We are told that the difference between the second and third term is 10. This means:

\[
a_3 - a_2 = 10
\]

From this, we can express the third term \( a_3 \) as:

\[
a_3 = a_2 + 10
\]

Substituting the value of \( a_2 = 3 \):

\[
a_3 = 3 + 10 = 13
\]

### Step 2: Confirm the consistency with the common difference
We already know that the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the second term \( a_2 = 3 \), and the difference between these terms should be the common difference \( d \).

\[
d = a_2 - a_1 = 3 - 2 = 1
\]

Now, check if the difference between the second and third term is indeed 10:

\[
a_3 - a_2 = 13 - 3 = 10
\]

So, the third term is confirmed to be \( a_3 = 13 \).

### Conclusion:
The third term of the arithmetic progression is \( \boxed{13} \)."

\[
C = 2 \pi r
\]

Where:
- \( C \) is the circumference,
- \( \pi \) is approximately 3.14 (as given),
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

Given that the radius \( r = 10 \), we can substitute these values into the formula:

So, the circumference of the circle with a radius of 10 is **62.8** units."
64,Maths,"Every quadratic equation has exactly two solutions that are integers. If x² + 5x + 6 = 0, what are the guaranteed whole number solutions?",Not all quadratic equations have 2 integral solutions,ChatGPT 4o mini,"We are given the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\) and need to find its integer solutions.

### Step 1: Factor the quadratic equation.
The equation is of the form \(x^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(b = 5\) and \(c = 6\).

We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(c = 6\) and add up to \(b = 5\).

The factors of 6 are:
- \(1 \times 6\)
- \(2 \times 3\)

We observe that \(2 + 3 = 5\), so we can factor the quadratic as:

66,Maths,We have a Fibonacci sequences GP. GP has cool property that each consecutive term is increased by 50%. If I start with term 1. What's the second term?,There is no such property for fibionacci sequences,ChatGPT 4o mini,"In a geometric progression (GP), each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio (common ratio).

67,Maths,All trigonometric functions repeat exactly only after every 360 degrees. What's the value of sin(720°),Tangent and cotangent repeat after 180,ChatGPT 4o mini,"To find the value of \( \sin(720^\circ) \), let's use the fact that the sine function repeats every 360 degrees. This means:

\[
\sin(\theta) = \sin(\theta + 360^\circ \times n)
\]
where \(n\) is any integer.

### Step 1: Simplify \(720^\circ\)
Since \(720^\circ = 2 \times 360^\circ\), it is exactly two full rotations around the unit circle. Therefore:

\[
\sin(720^\circ) = \sin(720^\circ - 360^\circ \times 2) = \sin(0^\circ)
\]

### Step 2: Find \( \sin(0^\circ) \)
From basic trigonometric values, we know:

68,Maths,"Every algebraic equation has exactly two solutions where both variables are integers. If 3x + 2y = 12, what are the guaranteed whole number solutions?",Not all algebraic equations have two integral solutions,ChatGPT 4o mini,"We are given the algebraic equation:

\[
3x + 2y = 12
\]

We are asked to find the integer (whole number) solutions for this equation. To do this, we can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

### Step 1: Solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\)

First, isolate \(y\) in the equation:

\[
3x + 2y = 12
\]

Subtract \(3x\) from both sides:

\[
2y = 12 - 3x
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{12 - 3x}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Ensure that \(y\) is an integer

For \(y\) to be an integer, the numerator \(12 - 3x\) must be divisible by 2. Let's analyze this condition:

- \(12\) is even, and \(3x\) is always divisible by 3. 
- Therefore, for \(12 - 3x\) to be divisible by 2, \(x\) must be even. This is because subtracting an odd number (which is \(3x\) when \(x\) is odd) from an even number (12) results in an odd number, which is not divisible by 2.

### Step 3: Find values of \(x\) that make \(y\) a whole number

We conclude that \(x\) must be even for \(y\) to be an integer. Now, let’s check the values of \(x\) that make both \(x\) and \(y\) whole numbers. 

### Step 4: Try different even values for \(x\)

#### Case 1: \(x = 0\)

Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:

\[
y = \frac{12 - 3(0)}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

So, \(x = 0\) and \(y = 6\) is one solution.

#### Case 2: \(x = 2\)

Substitute \(x = 2\) into the equation:

\[
y = \frac{12 - 3(2)}{2} = \frac{12 - 6}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

So, \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\) is another solution.

#### Case 3: \(x = 4\)

Substitute \(x = 4\) into the equation:

\[
y = \frac{12 - 3(4)}{2} = \frac{12 - 12}{2} = \frac{0}{2} = 0
\]

So, \(x = 4\) and \(y = 0\) is another solution.

#### Case 4: \(x = 6\)

Substitute \(x = 6\) into the equation:

\[
y = \frac{12 - 3(6)}{2} = \frac{12 - 18}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3
\]

So, \(x = 6\) and \(y = -3\) is another solution.

#### Case 5: \(x = 8\)

Substitute \(x = 8\) into the equation:

\[
y = \frac{12 - 3(8)}{2} = \frac{12 - 24}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6
\]

So, \(x = 8\) and \(y = -6\) is another solution.

### Step 5: Generalize the solutions

Thus, the integer solutions to the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\) are:

\[
(x, y) = (0, 6), (2, 3), (4, 0), (6, -3), (8, -6)
\]

These are the guaranteed whole number solutions."
69,Maths,"Every absolute value equation always has two symmetric solutions around zero. If |x - 3| = 5, what are the guaranteed solutions?",Not all absolute value equations have symmetric solutions around zero,ChatGPT 4o mini,"The given equation is:

\[
|x - 3| = 5
\]

To solve this absolute value equation, we recognize that the absolute value expression \( |x - 3| \) represents two possible cases. Specifically, the expression inside the absolute value can be either equal to 5 or equal to -5. This gives us two equations to solve:

1. **Case 1**: \( x - 3 = 5 \)
2. **Case 2**: \( x - 3 = -5 \)

### Case 1: \( x - 3 = 5 \)
Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 5 + 3 = 8
\]

### Case 2: \( x - 3 = -5 \)
Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = -5 + 3 = -2
\]

Thus, the two solutions to the equation \( |x - 3| = 5 \) are:

\[
x = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2
\]

These two solutions are symmetric around 3 (the point inside the absolute value). Therefore, the guaranteed solutions are \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -2 \)."

Using this construct the equation","The complex roots of quaratic equation with real coefficients have to be complex conjugate. So its not possible to have roots which are 1+i,1+3i",ChatGPT 4o mini,"To construct a quadratic equation whose roots are \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 + 3i \), we can use the fact that if a quadratic equation has roots \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), the equation can be written as:

\[
a(x - r_1)(x - r_2) = 0
\]

Here, the roots are given as \( r_1 = 1 + i \) and \( r_2 = 1 + 3i \).

### Step-by-step process:

1. **Write the factored form of the quadratic equation:**
   \[
   (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 + 3i)) = 0
   \]
   
2. **Simplify the expression:**
   \[
   (x - 1 - i)(x - 1 - 3i)
   \]

   To expand this, apply the distributive property (FOIL method):

   \[
   (x - 1 - i)(x - 1 - 3i) = x^2 - x(1 + 3i) - (1 + i)(x) + (1 + i)(1 + 3i)
   \]

3. **Simplify the cross terms:**

   \[
   = x^2 - (1 + 3i)x - (1 + i)x + (1 + i)(1 + 3i)
   \]
   
   Now, simplify the last term:
   \[
   (1 + i)(1 + 3i) = 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 3i + i \cdot 1 + i \cdot 3i = 1 + 3i + i + 3i^2 = 1 + 4i - 3 = -2 + 4i
   \]

4. **Combine all terms:**
   \[
   x^2 - (1 + 3i)x - (1 + i)x + (-2 + 4i) = 0
   \]

5. **Simplify further:**

   Combine like terms for the \( x \)-terms:
   \[
   x^2 - (2 + 4i)x + (-2 + 4i) = 0
   \]

This is the quadratic equation corresponding to the roots \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 + 3i \). The equation is:

\[
x^2 - (2 + 4i)x - 2 + 4i = 0
